A [Blender](https://blender.org>) add-on featuring import of [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com>)
games static meshes (stored in-game as .uasset) and maps (stored in-game as .umap). It provides basic support for many
UE games, while [some](https://skarndev.github.io/umodel_tools/supported_games.html) have dedicated improved support.
